# Scara Engraver
## Our Scara Plotter Proposal
![Scara Side View](Side_View_annotated.png)

> Our ink plotter draws inspiration from the SCARA robot. It will be a 2.5 DOF
> machine capable of moving in the x and y direction and half a degree of 
> freedom for the z-axis. The two axes move in a circular direction while the 
> laser engraver turns on and off. 
>
> A rough schematic of our Scara CAD model is shown above where the two arms
> are mounted atop a large base with motors pulling at each of these arms. 
> At the very end of the second arm is our large engraver which will follow 
> the path of our HPGL code to produce our image. As for manufacturing our 
> robot, we will include rotary thrust bearings and bushings to allow the arms 
> to rotate smoothly.
